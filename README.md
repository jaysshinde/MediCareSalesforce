# Medicare Data Analysis for Sales Force Prediction

This project focuses on analyzing Medicare data to predict and target specific doctors for the launch of a new injection. With over 20,000 rows of data, we aim to leverage data analytics techniques to provide insights and recommendations for the sales force to effectively target healthcare professionals.

## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to utilize Medicare data to identify key patterns and characteristics that can help predict the most relevant doctors for the launch of the new injection. By analyzing a comprehensive dataset, we aim to provide actionable recommendations to the sales force for targeted marketing strategies. The following steps were followed to achieve the project goals:

1. **Data**: Obtained Medicare data containing over 20,000 rows of information on healthcare providers, services rendered, and related attributes.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: Conducted data cleaning tasks, including handling missing values, removing duplicates, and standardizing formats. Ensured the data was ready for analysis.

3. **Data Analysis**: Utilized various data analytics techniques to explore patterns, correlations, and trends within the Medicare dataset. Employed statistical methods and visualization tools to gain insights.

5. **Targeting Strategy**: Generated recommendations for the sales force based on the predictive model results. Identified specific doctors who are likely to have a high propensity to prescribe the injection, enabling the sales team to target their efforts more effectively.
